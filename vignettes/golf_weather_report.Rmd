# The Golfer Package

## Introduction

This package allows you to view a map containing golf courses around Amsterdam.
You can click on the markers on the map to view weather conditions at your chosen
golf course, containing weather variables such as wind and humidity that impact 
your golf game.

In order to run the package, you'll need an OpenWeatherApp API key. 
You can easily obtain one for free from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api)

To start using, first load the package:

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(golfer)
```

## How it works

This package uses two key functions:

**1-** `weather_by_coords(lat, lon, api_key)`
Retrieves live weather data from OpenWeatherMap based on coordinates. 
You must enter your location's latitude and longitude, followed by your API key.
You can see the following weather variables:

- Temperature

- Humidity

- Pressure

- Wind (Strength and Direction)

- Cloudiness

- Visibility

- Overall Conditions

**2-** `golf_map_weather(api_key)`
Plots all golf courses on a leaflet map, attaching live weather data to each 
marker. For this one, you only need to enter your API key.

Here is the example usage for both:

```{r example_usage, eval = FALSE}
# Example usage
weather_by_coords(52.37, 4.89, api_key = "your_api_key")
golf_map_weather(api_key = "your_api_key")
```

## The Shiny App

The Shiny app for the Golfer package is the main feature of the project.
This combines the two functions introduced above in an app.
You can run the app by running this function:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
start_golf_app()
```

You will see a pop-up requesting your OpenWeatherApp API Key. Remember, the
app will not work unless you have a valid API! It will look like this:

Enter your API key. *Voila!* You will see the golf map pop up, as shown below:

You can click any of the markers on the map to view current weather conditions
at any golf course featured on the map:

## Notes

If faced with an error, please check that you are connected to the internet and
that your API key is valid.

## Conclusion

The golfer package is for the spontaneous Amsterdam golfer that wants to choose
the course they play on based on the weather conditions. Players can leverage 
these variables by adjusting their play to the conditions of the day. Golf away!
