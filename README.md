# The Golfer Package

This package is about golf!

Please read the vignette to read more about how to use the package.

There are numerous golf courses across the Netherlands, all of which experience
varying weather conditions. These conditions are very important to understand for
golfers. For example, knowing the strength and direction of the wind on a
particular golf course on a given day requires adjustments to one's swing and
aim. Golf is about creativity, and golfers need a good understanding of the
environment to get truly creative.

With this package, users with a valid OpenWeatherMap API key can view golf 
courses inside and close to Amsterdam as clickable markers on a map. Users can
click any golf course and view the live weather conditions such as wind, 
visibility, humidity, etc. that might affect their play. These variables allow
golfers to make more informed choices when selecting a golf club to go to, and 
adjust their play according to the conditions.

## How it works

The golfer package is a Shiny app, and requires an internet connection, a valid OpenWeatherMap API key, and an interactive R session.
