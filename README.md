# golfer-project

This package is about golf!

There are numerous golf courses across the Netherlands, all of which experience
varying weather conditions. These conditions are very important to understand for
golfers. For example, knowing the strength and direction of the wind on a
particular golf course on a given day requires adjustments to one's swing and
aim. Golf is about creativity, and golfers need a good understanding of the
environment to get truly creative.

In this project, I hope to select a number of prominent golf courses, displayed
as location needles on a map. A user will be able to click on a golf course of
their choosing and simply view the weather conditions at that course. Sometimes
the urge to golf can be spontaneous, and this project helps golfers choose the
optimal course to go to at a moments notice.
